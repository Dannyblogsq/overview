# Organizing resources in resource groups
{: #whatis}

A resource group is a way for you to organize your account resources in customizable groupings, so that you can quickly assign users access to more than one resource at a time. Any account resource that is managed using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) access control belongs to a resource group within your account. When you add a new resource to your account from the catalog, you can assign the resource to a resource group.

Services that are managed using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} IAM and belong to a resource group have several benefits including the ability to connect to apps and services in any Cloud Foundry space, which allows you to connect apps and services from different regions. Because resource groups are not scoped by region, you can provision apps and services from different regions into the same resource group. You also have the ability to use fine-grained access control down to an individual instance within a resource group.

For more information about working with resource groups, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account/resourcegroups.html).
