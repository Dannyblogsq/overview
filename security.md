{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ensures security readiness by adhering to security policies that are driven by best practices in IBM for systems, networking, and secure engineering. These policies include practices such as source code scanning, dynamic scanning, threat modeling, and penetration testing. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} follows the IBM Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) process for security incident management. See the [IBM Security Vulnerability Management (PSIRT) ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/process.html){: new_window} site for details.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public and Dedicated use classic infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud services and take full advantage of its security architecture. Classic IaaS provides multiple, overlapping tiers of protection for your applications and data. For {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Local, you own the physical security, and provide the infrastructure by hosting {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Local in your own data center behind a company firewall. In addition, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} adds security capabilities at the platform as a service (PaaS) layer in different categories: platform, data, and application. For further security details on your environment and apps in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, see [Securing applications and environments on cloud ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/securityArchitecture){: new_window}.
