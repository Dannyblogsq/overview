# Shared responsibilities for using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offerings
{: #shared-responsibilities}

In {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, as is the case for other cloud service providers, the responsibilities for managing the lifecycle of, operating, and securing offerings are shared between {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} and the customer.

The responsibility of completing the following types of tasks on various offerings can be can be exclusive to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, the customer, or shared between the two. The tasks for each type of offering are grouped in the following categories:

* Incident and operations management: Includes tasks such as monitoring, event management, high availability, problem determination, recovery, and full state backup and recovery.
* Change management: Includes tasks such as deployment, configuration, upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and deletion.
* Identity and access management: Includes tasks such as authentication, authorization, access control policies, and approving, granting, and revoking access.
* Security and regulation compliance: Includes tasks such as security controls implementation and compliance certification.
* Disaster recovery: Includes tasks such as providing dependencies on disaster recovery sites, provision disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports the following types of offerings and the corresponding shared responsibility models.

## Infrastructure-as-a-service 
{: #iaas-services-responsibilities}

Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} are fully multi-tenant, accessed remotely, hosted on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} physical infrastructure, created in customer-owned accounts, and have control plane and data plane security that is owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. Examples of this offerings type are Virtual Servers and Bare Metal Servers with the related block volumes connected to the customer account private subnets.

## Fully-managed offerings
{: #fully-managed-responsibilities}

Offerings that are fully managed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} require customer responsibilities only for the data or applications that customers add to the service. They are multi-tenant, accessed remotely, hosted on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} virtual resources, created in IBM-owned accounts, and have control plane and data plane security that is owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. Examples of this offering type are {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} databases or {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} database instances.

## Self-managed offerings
{: #self-managed-responsibilities}

Self-managed offerings are orchestrated by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, meaning they are single-tenant and data plane offerings. In addition, they are accessed locally in customer accounts, data plane hosted on virtual resources in the customer's account, control plane security owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, and data plane security owned by the customer. Examples of this offering type are {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} clusters and worker nodes created in the customer account.

## Software packages

Software packages are deployed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} as single tenant instances, and they are accessed locally in the customer account. The software instance is hosted on resources in the customer's accounts. The software deployment control plane security is owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, and the software instance security is owned by the customer.

There is a generic software deployment control plane that manages the lifecycle of deployed software package instances. At a minimum, it manages the deployment, upgrade, and delete actions. As the packages become smarter, the generic control plane might also manage the start, stop, migration, scaling, monitoring, backup, and restore tasks.
