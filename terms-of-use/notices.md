SANCTIONS & EMBARGOES

The United States prohibits most commercial transactions and other dealings with a handful of countries for foreign policy and national security reasons.  These prohibitions – formally known as trade and economic sanctions or comprehensive embargoes – currently target Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and Syria. 

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} implements network-wide blocking of communications to IP addresses which originate from countries subject to those trade and economic sanctions. This policy affects all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center locations and environments, and blocks access by IP addresses registered to countries subject to U.S. trade and economic sanctions.

To identify IP addresses associated with U.S. embargoed countries, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} references the Geo IP2 Database maintained by [MaxMind ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://www.maxmind.com){: new_window}). {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} updates its IP address country mapping on a quarterly basis.

Note: This restriction does not apply to content that is not prohibited under U.S. sanctions and embargoes. Please email IBM_Cloud_Embargo_Exemption_Request@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com if you believe your content is not prohibited under U.S. trade and economic sanctions.
