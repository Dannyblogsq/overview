# Managing the catalog
{: #manage-catalog}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} catalog displays your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources across geographies. Resources in the catalog can include services, infrastructure, and templates. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command-line interface (CLI) to search the catalog, view details on catalog resources, and manage the visibility of your catalog resources.

To create resources from the catalog, see [Working in the catalog](/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#catalogcreate).

## Managing visibility
{: #manage-vis}

Do you want more control over what gets displayed in the catalog? Would you like to hide individual resources for some users, and display them to others? With the proper administrator authority, you can view and set visibility on catalog resources by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).

For more information, see the following topics.

* If you're an administrator for the account, you can choose to [hide](/docs/account?topic=account-exclude) a public resource for everyone in your account.
* If you're an administrator for the account, you can choose who can see your resource by [adding](/docs/account?topic=account-include) them to an include list.
* You can [change account ownership](/docs/account?topic=account-include#owners) with the command line interface.
