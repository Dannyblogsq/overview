## Product release levels
{: #release-levels}

Products are available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog at various release levels, including general availability (GA), select availability, beta, or experimental. Depending on a product's release level, various levels of [support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar), committed warranties, or service level agreements (SLAs) are available.

* GA products are widely available for sale and delivery to customers or channels, usually across multiple geographies.
* Select availability products are production-ready, available for sale, and accessible to select customers.
* Beta products are made solely available for evaluation and testing purposes. There are no warranties, SLAs, or support provided and beta products are not intended for production use.
* Experimental products are made solely available for evaluation and testing purposes, and might be unstable or not compatible with previous versions. An experimental product can be discontinued with short notice. There are no warranties, SLAs, or support provided, and experimental products are not intended for production use.


## Product deprecation
{: #service_deprecation}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides at least 30 days notice of its intention to discontinue or replace a generally available product. If an equivalent replacement isn't provided, for at least 12 months from the date of that announcement, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} uses commercially reasonable means to continue the operation and support of previously deployed instances of the product.
