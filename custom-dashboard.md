## Adding widgets
{: #add-widget}

## Removing widgets
{: #remove-widget}

You can clean up your dashboard by clicking the Close icon ![Close icon](../icons/close-icon.svg) that's located in the upper-right corner of each widget.

## Reorganizing your dashboard
{: #reorg-dashboard}

You can rearrange the order of the widgets on your dashboard by grabbing a widget and moving it accordingly. For example, as an account owner, tracking who has access to your account might be a top priority for you. You want these details to be displayed at the top of your dashboard, but you currently have to scroll to find the User access widget. Grab the widget to move it to the top of your dashboard.
